## Updating Content
Everything inside of [`src/content/pages`](https://github.com/Haussprecher-JWW19/jww19-website/tree/main/src/content/pages) is considered the content of the web page. The idea is that you do not need to understand the rest of the project if you only want to fix a mistake or add content to the website. You can simply go ahead and edit the markdown files.

However, if you want to preview the changes locally, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed and follow the steps for development below.

## Development
1. ```shell
   npm install
   ```
2. ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```
