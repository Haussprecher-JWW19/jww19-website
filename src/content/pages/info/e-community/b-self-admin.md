## Student Self-Administration
If you have ever felt the need to complain about life in our dorm and are passionate about improving our living situation, becoming part of the student self-administration will help you achieve this. Also, if you have ever felt that the dorm requires more activities and events, then joining the student self-administration and helping us organize events is a great way to contribute to the community. 

We've outlined the traditional roles of the student self-administration below, but if you're an active member of the community, you are always welcome to join us anyway, regardless of whether you have an elected role or not.

### House Speaker
We have 2 house speakers for our dorm and they are mainly responsible for communicating between the residents of the dorm and the Studierendenwerk. We prefer the house speaker to be someone who has already been part of the student self-administration, since they need to understand quite a bit about how the dorm works. You can read more about their role [here](https://www.studierendenwerk-muenchen-oberbayern.de/en/accommodation/policies-and-application-forms/translate-to-english-haussprecher/). House speakers get elected for a one year term and are then eligible for extending their residency by 2 semesters. 

Our current house speakers' terms end after this semester (winter semester of 2022) and the summer semester of 2023.

### Tutor
We have 2 tutors that are responsible for organizing events and fostering the social life of our dorm. We used to only have 1 tutor position, but we've split the position in to two, sothat it's easier to plan more events. You can read more about their role [here](https://www.studierendenwerk-muenchen-oberbayern.de/en/culture/resident-tutor-programme/). Tutors get elected for a one year term and are then eligible for extending their residency by 1 semester. 

Both our current tutors' terms end after the summer semester of 2023.

### Network Admin
We have 3 network admins that are responsible for helping residents [set up their internet](#d-internet-guide) as well as maintaining this website. 

Network admins get elected every semester and 2 of the network admins are eligible for extending their residency by 1 semester.

### Floor Speaker
We have 4 floor speakers (one for each floor) and they are responsible for ensuring that the common room on their designated floor stays clean (they also get thoroughly cleaned by the caretaker though). They used to collect donations from their floor for the student self-administration at the beginning of each semester, but this practice has unfortunately died out.

Floor speakers get elected every semester and are only eligible for extending their residency by means of an honorary semester, but they are usually top candidates.

### Haussprecher
Wir haben 2 Haussprecher für unser Wohnheim dessen Hauptaufgabe es ist zwischen Mitbewohnern und dem Studierendenwerk zu kommunizieren. Wir bevorzugen es den Haussprecherposten mit einer Person zu besetzen, die bereits Teil der studentischen Selbstverwaltung war, weil man einiges über die Funktionsweise des Wohnheims verstehen muss. [Hier](https://www.studierendenwerk-muenchen-oberbayern.de/wohnen/richtlinien-und-antraege/haussprecher/) gibt es mehr Infos zu der Rolle des Haussprechers. Haussprecher werden außerdem auf eine 1-jährige Amtszeit gewählt und können ihre Wohnzeit danach um 2 Semester verlängern.

Die Amtszeiten unserer derzeitigen Haussprecher enden jeweils nach dem Wintersemester 2022 und dem Sommersemester 2023.

### Tutor
Wir haben 2 Tutoren des Hauptaufgabe es ist Veranstaltungen zu organisieren und das soziale Leben in unserem Wohnheim zu fördern. Wir hatten vor einigen Jahren nur einen Tutor, aber haben dessen Rolle auf 2 Leute verteilt, damit wir mehr Veranstaltungen planen können. Ihr könnt [hier](https://www.studierendenwerk-muenchen-oberbayern.de/kultur/tutorenprogramm/) mehr über die Aufgaben von Tutoren lesen. Tutoren werden auf eine 1-jährige Amtszeit gewählt und können ihre Wohnzeit danach um 1 Semester verlängern.

Die Amtszeit beider unsere derzeitigen Tutoren endet nach dem Sommersemester 2023.

### Netzwerkadmin
Wir haben 3 Netzwerkadmins die euch beim [Einrichten eures Internets](#d-internet-guide) helfen können und auch diese Website warten.

Netzwerkadmins werden jedes Semester neu gewählt. 2 der Netzwerkadmins können ihre Wohnzeit um 1 Semester verlängern.

### Stockwerksprecher
Wir haben 4 Stockwerksprecher (einen für jedes Stockwerk) und sie sind dafür verantwortlich die Gemeinschaftsräume auf Sauberkeit zu inspizieren und im Notfall zu reinigen. Die Gemeinschaftsräume werden jedoch von der Hausmeisterin gereinigt. Es war mal Teil deren Aufgabe zu Beginn jeden Semesters Spenden für die studentische Selbstverwaltung einzusammeln, aber wir sammeln seit einigen Jahren schon keine Spenden mehr ein.

Stockwerksprecher werden jedes Semester neu gewählt und können ihre Wohnzeit nur durch ein Honorarsemester verlängern. Sie sind meistens die Topkandidaten für Honorarsemester.
